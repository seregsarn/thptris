Thptris
=======

An implementation of tetris that lives in the favicon of the browser window.

Be warned: This is awful code that I wrote mostly on a lunch break at work
one day. We had been talking about procedural favicon stuff at work, and I
thought to myself, "what's something cool and dynamic I can do with a 16x16
display to play with some of these things?" A friend of mine is a Tetris
fanatic, so that sprung to mind and a short while later I had a barely-
working implementation. Then when I got home I ended up fleshing it out a
bit and adding features like scoring and wallkicks, so now it should work
like most any respectable tetris implementation.
